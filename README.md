# Sierpinski-Gasket-Triangle

The research was to prove the adjacency of that fractals such as the Sierpinski Gasket Triangle can be applied to the prediction of real-world phenomena.

I developed a MATLAB and Python algorithm to find the adjacency matrix of any level of the Sierpinski Gasket Triangle. The algorithm works by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller triangles, and then using the connectivity of the triangles to construct the adjacency matrix. The algorithm also sketches the fractal, which is a self-similar pattern that can be infinitely subdivided.

I demonstrated the validity of fractal adjacency and its real-world applications by applying the algorithm to mathematical theories such as Coupled Map Lattices, The Eulerâ€“Maruyama Method, and Opinion Dynamics on Graphon. These theories show that fractal adjacency can be used to model a variety of natural and social phenomena, such as the spread of disease, the evolution of populations, and the formation of social networks.
